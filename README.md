html5-photo-gps
====================

Simple standalone HTML5 webapp that shows your address and lets you take a photo or pick from library with a notes field. Built as lightweight alternative for those who may be using Phonegap to achieve this functionality when the bloat of it isn't always necessary. 

Makes use of the input "accepts" attribute, and the HTML5 geolocation API.
